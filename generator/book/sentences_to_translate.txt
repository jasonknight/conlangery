From Sappho:

	Shimmering-throned immortal Aphrodite,
	Daughter of Zeus, Enchantress, I implore thee,
	Spare me, O queen, this agony and anguish,
	     Crush not my spirit

	eryn-vaatho't otai tsamazh APHRODITE,
	ZEUSte solai, otai feolazh, saron vaakresa 
	u deothuso, athotai vaadonto, hibahn zha taidazh sith
		ute zhavaan bae vestuso ar 

	Whenever before thou has hearkened to me--
	To my voice calling to thee in the distance,
	And heeding, thou hast come, leaving thy father's
	     Golden dominions,

	psudiso't stojave 
	athotai baidansikh ute psaidaase thaemona nor
	rejaso't, athotaite bukkahdte sulojet vaadarsaj 
		ga'uso't

	With chariot yoked to thy fleet-winged coursers,
	Fluttering swift pinions over earth's darkness,
	And bringing thee through the infinite, gliding
	     Downwards from heaven,

	vainka athotaite ket fathe psikhon kobega,
	pidonte ravdo urmet ket fodaht vologa,
	athotai steovaga kathonur, haansikh usham
		porseso
		
	Then, soon they arrived and thou, blessed goddess,
	With divine contenance smiling, didst ask me
	What new woe had befallen me now and why,
	     Thus I had called the.

	kaipurz athotai k'uunto, pilaga't zha pilaso't thinave
	nakhat tolaht ngadopana ka, u tsoguso't
	daifu thoazh u psarana jal dezra hais,
		athotai thaemosa suth 

	What in my mad heart was my greatest desire,
	Who was it now that must feel my allurements,
	Who was the fair one that must be persuaded,
	     Who wronged thee Sappho?

	ute kuyu thevej ute tsiethe vagejdak sahuna't jal,
	ute thitaht ngiakona maldena sahuna't toora
	hita tsedan'la kraegona maldena sahuna't toora
		SAPPHOtera tursana toora

	For if now she flees, quickly she shall follow
	And if she spurns gifts, soon shall she offer them
	Yea, if she knows not love, soon shall she feel it
	     Even reluctant.

	Come then, I pray, grant me surcease from sorrow,
	Drive away care, I beseech thee, O goddess
	Fulfil for me what I yearn to accomplish,
	     Be thou my ally.

	He who learns must suffer
	And even in our sleep pain that cannot forget
	Falls drop by drop upon the heart,
	And in our own despite, against our will,
	Comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God.

	daiduna'yi todana maldena
